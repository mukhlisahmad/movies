WEBVTT

00:53.720 --> 00:55.472
I am Knull.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.349
God of the void.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.852
Slicer of worlds.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.104
Long ago,

01:02.187 --> 01:05.065
when light invaded my kingdom,

01:05.147 --> 01:08.318
my symbiote children betrayed me

01:09.069 --> 01:11.530
and imprisoned me here.

01:15.868 --> 01:19.454
At last,
a codex has been created.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.749
It is the key to my freedom.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.878
It will unlock this prison.

01:26.003 --> 01:30.257
I order you to search
the corners of the universe

01:30.340 --> 01:33.594
until you find this key.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.930
Find me the codex.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.564
And when I escape,

01:45.647 --> 01:47.941
and annihilate
every living planet

01:48.025 --> 01:52.070
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

01:52.196 --> 01:54.281
I will reward you...

01:55.115 --> 01:56.617
with your lives.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.821
So you're saying
in this universe,

02:34.905 --> 02:36.740
there's these superhero people.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.950
All right.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.912
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

02:41.995 --> 02:43.956
who really loves stones.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.875
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

02:46.959 --> 02:50.379
aliens, they do not love stones.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.672
-Eddie, don't start.
-No.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.132
No, they do not love stones.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.051
Do you know what they love?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.137
They love eating brains!

02:59.930 --> 03:01.056
Because that's what they do.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.394
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.603
For five years.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.858
Five years, huh?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.194
Well, that is a long time.

03:15.821 --> 03:16.822
All right.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.031
Eddie!

03:18.782 --> 03:20.325
We are drunk!

03:33.881 --> 03:35.257
We're home!

03:35.340 --> 03:37.259
I'm so done
with the multi-verse shit.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.970
And I like our version
of the barman better.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.639
Ow. My head hurts.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.141
I feel like I'm drunk,

03:44.224 --> 03:46.560
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.812
Eddie! You want a Bloody María.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.480
Oh, yeah!

03:54.109 --> 03:56.069
-No.
-I don't want a drink.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.117
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar!

04:08.832 --> 04:09.875
Tequila!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.628
I'm having the time
of my life, Eddie!

04:13.837 --> 04:15.464
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.882
Be a man, Eddie.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.053
We should've been a bartender!

04:25.474 --> 04:27.017
-Tequila!
-I did it.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.143
I did it.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.190
What the hell were those things?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.901
I was born with them.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.197
Freaking bar!
I'm done with this shit!

04:42.908 --> 04:45.661
This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.080
Police are still
trying to locate

04:48.163 --> 04:49.790
former reporter
Eddie Brock for questioning...

04:49.873 --> 04:51.083
Oh, no.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.127
...after the tragic death
of Detective Patrick Mulligan.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.337
No.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.589
Detective Mulligan
was found impaled

04:57.673 --> 05:00.175
amidst a series
of bizarre happenings

05:00.259 --> 05:01.677
at the city's cathedral.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.387
They think that I killed him.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.514
How long can he
evade authorities?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.015
Only time will tell.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.434
If we are on the news here,

05:09.518 --> 05:12.437
we are on the news everywhere.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.816
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.359
And I'm not staying down here,

05:17.442 --> 05:20.153
hiding for the rest of my life
in Mexico, that's for sure.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.446
Where will we go?

05:21.530 --> 05:23.365
I don't know. I don't know.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.537
Ooh.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.498
That could work. Hey.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.749
This judge got me

05:32.833 --> 05:34.668
-kicked out of New York.
-What a dick!

05:34.751 --> 05:37.379
Yeah, I still got a ton
of shit on him too.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.924
I've always wanted
to see the Statue of Liberty.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.177
Maybe we could blackmail him.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.305
And clear my name.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.389
Let's go!

05:48.056 --> 05:50.684
-Road trip!
-Let's get the hell out of here.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.395
Keep the change!

05:59.067 --> 06:02.029
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.909
We are fugitives!

06:06.992 --> 06:09.453
We are on the run!

06:09.578 --> 06:12.247
Yes, we are innocent. Yes.

06:12.331 --> 06:16.502
But I will eat every bad guy
that gets in our way.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.337
I need a Tylenol.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.726
Do you hear that?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.281
Someone's in trouble.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.325
And I need fuel for the road.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.409
Yeah, okay.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.890
That way.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.194
Bad men, Eddie.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.032
Are we the Lethal Protector,
or not?

07:33.328 --> 07:34.580
Do your thing.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.706
Easy-peasy.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.515
Jesus.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.441
Cute!

08:02.524 --> 08:04.234
I promise not to eat it.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.113
They're fighting dogs.

08:08.197 --> 08:11.200
I draw the line
at fighting dogs, pal.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.417
Oye, vato,
you're in the wrong place.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.961
Oh, hello.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.546
This is our territory.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.508
Well, I assume

08:27.633 --> 08:29.343
by the threatening look
on your faces

08:29.426 --> 08:32.261
that I oughta be scared, right?

08:34.681 --> 08:37.893
But you took
the wrong path, hermano.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.352
We can't let you leave.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.523
I have a headache

08:42.606 --> 08:46.193
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.277
I'm gonna be honest.

08:47.402 --> 08:51.740
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.492
We all have monsters inside us.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.369
Not like this.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.955
So dark that it is highly likely

08:58.080 --> 09:01.375
to tear your head off
and feed it

09:01.458 --> 09:02.543
to your asshole.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.419
Or me! You can feed it to me!

09:04.503 --> 09:05.963
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.758
All right. Look. Come on.
I got a suggestion.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.051
No. Stop speaking.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.136
I'm not gonna stop speaking.
This is for you.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.389
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.891
I don't have to. Okay?
So pay attention.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.060
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

09:20.185 --> 09:22.521
because what you're doing
is reprehensible.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.315
What does your mother
think of you, man?

09:25.399 --> 09:27.317
My mother's dead, culero.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.694
You made it awkward!

09:29.361 --> 09:30.362
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.415
I'm giving you a chance.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.792
Sweetie, I really am
giving you a chance.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.169
You should probably take it.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.302
Say when.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.720
When.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.190
Hola, bitches.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.008
Who's a bad boy?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.100
Now that's some sturdy footwear!

10:45.229 --> 10:46.355
Where you going?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.191
Home.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.359
Nah.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.993
What...

11:01.078 --> 11:02.079
are you?

11:04.289 --> 11:05.749
We are...

11:05.832 --> 11:07.417
We are Venom!

11:07.501 --> 11:09.086
We are...

11:09.169 --> 11:10.796
-Venom!
-No!

11:10.879 --> 11:12.214
-Oh!
-Yeah.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.423
-We...
-We...

11:13.507 --> 11:16.260
are Venom.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.095
What?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.182
We are totally gonna
need to work on that.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.110
That was delicious!

11:33.235 --> 11:34.945
You're welcome.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.488
Thank you.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.283
You take me
to all the finest places!

11:39.366 --> 11:41.118
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.494
Where's my shoe?

11:43.412 --> 11:44.830
Oh, hey, buddy!

11:44.913 --> 11:47.124
That's my shoe!
That's my shoe. That's my shoe!

11:47.249 --> 11:48.792
Give me my shoe.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.259
These will fit.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.219
Now we are on the run

11:59.344 --> 12:01.221
for something
we actually did do.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.807
And I got stuck with a superhero
who can't fly.

12:03.891 --> 12:04.892
Wanna bet?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.085
There you are.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.049
Get me General Strickland.

12:56.902 --> 12:57.903
What the...?

13:06.495 --> 13:07.871
Viral shedding.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.832
These things wanna live.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.094
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.893
He was acting, like, crazy.
Talking to himself.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.062
What was he saying?

13:33.230 --> 13:38.402
He had these big,
massive, wild arms.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.862
They were bobbling like this.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.365
Bring him.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.386
You think there are another
brother and sister

14:04.469 --> 14:05.637
on one of those stars...

14:07.097 --> 14:09.057
looking at the same sky?

14:09.725 --> 14:11.018
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.607
My twin brother...

14:16.690 --> 14:18.567
a future NASA scientist.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.111
One day.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.909
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.719
No!

15:18.085 --> 15:19.378
He's on life support.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.797
Get him
to emergency symbiosis now.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.603
It should be you.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.357
This just came across
our news desk

15:40.440 --> 15:41.441
and it bears repeating:

15:41.525 --> 15:44.945
For all of you alien enthusiasts
out there, it's a sad day.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.949
Washington has finally announced
the decommissioning of Area 51.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.659
The controversial site is famous

15:50.742 --> 15:52.995
for its alleged testing
on aliens.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.454
In other news today...

16:07.801 --> 16:10.387
Right this way. Come on up.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.363
-Strickland.
-Strickland authorised.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.089
-It's finally happening, then.
-Yeah.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.135
Yes, ma'am. Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.887
And roaches.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.306
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill 'em.

16:54.389 --> 16:57.518
They've been around 280 million
years. And counting.

16:57.601 --> 16:58.894
I did not know that, Dr Paine.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.277
Good to go.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.904
-Have a good one, Gus.
-You too.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.065
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.282
Morning, Dr Paine,
we'll keep 'em safe for you.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.200
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.994
Never judge a book by its cover.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.168
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.587
Looks like
all your dreams came true.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.839
I know how that must bug you.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.050
He arrived shortly
before you did.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.886
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.721
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.805
What?

18:16.889 --> 18:18.348
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.102
-Morning.
-Good morning.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.688
The bonding was successful.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.898
I heard.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.196
You always have this
look on your face

18:32.279 --> 18:33.614
like something terrible
is imminent.

18:33.739 --> 18:34.823
Because in my line of work

18:34.907 --> 18:36.992
something terrible
is always imminent.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.494
We contain them, you study them.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.079
It's how it works.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.505
Let's have a look.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.340
-Hello, doctor.
-Morning.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.592
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.304
We saved him.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.555
He would have died.

19:02.226 --> 19:03.435
Oh, try lowering those levels.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.693
Morning, Sadie.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.153
Let me get that.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.905
We got this down in Mexico.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.199
Hi. Welcome.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.868
Any more on
where the rest of him is?

19:19.993 --> 19:22.412
-We're gettin' there.
-Update me as you have it.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.291
I don't get this obsession.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.710
I told you.
My mom made me this pin.

19:28.836 --> 19:29.878
It's July.

19:30.879 --> 19:31.964
I'll see you in there.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.467
Everyone on this side...

19:36.426 --> 19:38.178
is weird.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.721
Leave her alone, Rex.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.808
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.032
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

19:59.116 --> 20:00.367
by the end of the week.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.910
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

20:01.994 --> 20:03.745
and they're tired
of the tourists.

20:03.871 --> 20:06.164
But we don't exist down here.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.624
A hundred feet subsurface...

20:07.749 --> 20:10.252
undetectable to any human...

20:11.086 --> 20:12.421
or non-human.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.882
No one's phoning home from here.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.341
My brother's greatest ambition

20:16.425 --> 20:19.261
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.513
And I wish
I could have shown him

20:21.597 --> 20:22.764
what we've built down here.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.228
You're okay.

20:28.979 --> 20:29.980
Just...

20:31.315 --> 20:33.358
try to breathe. Okay?

20:34.985 --> 20:36.445
When my brother and I were kids

20:36.528 --> 20:39.948
they told us that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.243
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.454
Cool story.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.539
Where are you going? This first.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.333
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

20:50.209 --> 20:52.503
It's not us I'm worried about.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.047
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

20:55.130 --> 20:56.757
that could be harmful
to a sensitive life form.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.426
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.720
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

21:08.727 --> 21:10.395
This is the first time
we've had a host

21:10.521 --> 21:11.855
compatible with
one of our symbiotes.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.857
And now we'll be able
to talk to one.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.194
Monsters.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.546
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.465
You try "Jingle Bells"?
So soothing.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.676
Wow, why didn't I think of that?

21:42.803 --> 21:44.012
Release him.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.726
Monsters.

21:52.688 --> 21:54.940
I'm Dr Paine. Teddy.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.526
You're safe here.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.111
I'm going to help you.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.655
Both of you.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.659
The transfer was successful.

22:06.869 --> 22:08.078
We had no choice.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.788
We had to try and save you.

22:17.296 --> 22:18.630
Monsters.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.931
You're broken too.

22:36.940 --> 22:37.941
May I...?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.697
May I ask you some questions?

22:49.077 --> 22:51.413
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

22:54.124 --> 22:55.250
Do you hear it?

22:58.545 --> 23:00.130
Sound distresses them.

23:02.883 --> 23:03.884
Okay.

23:07.513 --> 23:09.598
-Why are they here?
-What do they want?

23:09.723 --> 23:10.891
Safe haven.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.601
Safe haven?

23:12.726 --> 23:14.353
We were running.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.647
Is he talking
about the other symbiotes?

23:16.730 --> 23:18.148
I think so.

23:18.941 --> 23:22.444
His creatures
search the universe for us.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.905
But we will be found.

23:27.157 --> 23:30.452
And when we are,
he will kill us all.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.664
Who?

23:34.373 --> 23:35.958
There will be nothing left.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.460
Here? On Earth?

23:42.172 --> 23:43.298
Why were they running?

23:44.466 --> 23:47.761
Because there is a dark,

23:47.845 --> 23:50.973
cold sea

23:51.056 --> 23:53.350
around this universe.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.852
What is it?

24:02.568 --> 24:04.862
You don't wanna know.

24:14.204 --> 24:16.832
I've seen the future.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.768
The darkness

24:38.187 --> 24:42.399
has teeth.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.864
This is your captain speaking.

24:48.947 --> 24:52.868
We are currently cruising
at a comfortable 31,000 feet.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.662
If you look out there
to your left just now,

24:55.746 --> 24:57.956
you'll see the Grand Canyon.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.502
Told you we could fly.

25:01.585 --> 25:02.961
Oh, my God!

25:03.045 --> 25:04.338
Direct to New York.

25:04.421 --> 25:06.298
My mouth is so dry!

25:06.381 --> 25:08.050
And we clear your name.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.219
It's so unpleasantly cold!

25:11.970 --> 25:13.597
How does Tom Cruise do this?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.641
He doesn't whine
like a little bitch!

25:27.653 --> 25:28.862
What was that?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.408
What is that?

25:33.492 --> 25:35.202
Oh, fuck!

25:58.517 --> 26:00.978
I'm sorry, Eddie,
but I got to disappear.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.021
-What, now?
-We're in deep shit!

26:05.315 --> 26:07.359
Why did you do that?

26:08.193 --> 26:09.653
I will explain.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.447
No! No!

26:16.201 --> 26:17.911
No! No!

26:23.876 --> 26:25.127
I'm gonna go ahead and say that

26:25.210 --> 26:27.713
this is the shittest hangover
of all time.

26:28.589 --> 26:30.090
Look at it, Eddie.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.885
Isn't it just astonishing?

26:32.968 --> 26:34.303
Oh, shut up.

26:34.428 --> 26:37.055
I don't think
I mind living here forever.

26:37.139 --> 26:40.559
We just came face-to-face
with a literal death machine.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.187
Forever seems pretty optimistic.

26:49.109 --> 26:52.321
With the decommissioning
of Area 51, will the Pentagon...

26:52.446 --> 26:54.907
...finally admit that
they've been holding UAPs?

26:54.990 --> 26:57.910
That's "unidentified aerial
phenomena" to you.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.369
Yeah, Dad, we know.

26:59.494 --> 27:02.122
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.999
That's why we cashed in
our savings

27:04.082 --> 27:05.959
and came on this
road trip, babe.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.836
So you could finally
get to see--

27:07.920 --> 27:09.004
That it's bullshit?

27:09.087 --> 27:10.506
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

27:10.631 --> 27:12.174
Then I really hope
we don't end up

27:12.257 --> 27:14.301
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.345
Or dead.

27:16.470 --> 27:17.679
"Asses."

27:27.773 --> 27:29.191
Kicked up some gravel there.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.193
-Hang tight, family.
-You good?

27:31.318 --> 27:33.195
That was wild!

27:33.320 --> 27:34.863
-Did the dog vomit?
-Yeah.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.378
Okay!

27:49.503 --> 27:50.796
We've got this.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.215
Soft landing. Bend your knees.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.384
Engage your core.
Engage your core!

27:56.426 --> 27:59.555
Yes! Yes, that's it!
Yes. That's it!

28:02.808 --> 28:04.059
Well done.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.686
That was terrifying.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.356
This is not New York.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.941
No, this is a wasteland.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.776
I'm detecting
passive aggression.

28:12.860 --> 28:13.861
-Are you?
-Yeah.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.655
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some active aggression?

28:16.738 --> 28:19.700
You just threw me off a 757

28:19.783 --> 28:21.827
without even
the slightest consideration

28:21.910 --> 28:23.745
for my chronic vertigo.

28:23.829 --> 28:25.622
It was an Airbus A320.

28:25.706 --> 28:28.542
Was it? I am sorry. All right.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.961
And what was that thing?

28:31.044 --> 28:33.130
That thing
that we just juiced back there?

28:33.213 --> 28:34.715
You're not going to like this.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.593
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.180
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

28:41.263 --> 28:43.182
That's er... You're being weird.
That's creepy.

28:43.265 --> 28:45.017
That was a Xenophage.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.101
A what?

28:46.185 --> 28:47.853
A Xenophage.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.980
-A symbiote hunter.
-Of course.

28:50.063 --> 28:52.858
Problem is, if she has found
her way here,

28:52.941 --> 28:54.484
others will soon follow.

28:54.610 --> 28:55.736
"Others"?

28:55.819 --> 28:59.531
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.158
So that's your sister?

29:01.283 --> 29:04.494
All the symbiotes turned on him,
locked him up on Klyntar.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.704
-Your planet.
-No!

29:05.829 --> 29:07.456
-Not a planet.
-Not your planet.

29:07.581 --> 29:09.499
A prison we built for him
to sleep...

29:09.625 --> 29:11.460
-Of course.
-...for eternity!

29:12.211 --> 29:13.212
What's his name, then?

29:14.630 --> 29:16.340
I didn't hear a word you said.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.466
Knull.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.717
-Knull.
-No!

29:18.800 --> 29:20.469
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

29:23.263 --> 29:25.474
This is serious, Eddie.

29:25.557 --> 29:26.808
Let's just not talk.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.853
Quiet.

29:34.483 --> 29:37.319
What does this
Xyla-Xyn-Xyn-thingy,

29:37.402 --> 29:39.279
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

29:39.363 --> 29:42.950
It doesn't. It wants us.
We have something it needs.

29:43.033 --> 29:47.746
We only have this shitty shirt,
we got one boot and sunburn.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.456
And the codex.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.666
The what, now?

29:50.749 --> 29:52.125
I'll show you.

29:53.669 --> 29:55.879
Damn it, what are you doing?

29:55.963 --> 29:59.049
Let's say you died.
I could bring you back to life.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.217
Well, I like that.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.095
But if I did,
our separate life forces

30:03.178 --> 30:08.058
would become one single force
called a codex.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.935
What the hell is a codex?

30:10.018 --> 30:14.231
It's a key.
A key that unlocks a cage.

30:14.356 --> 30:15.941
The prison on Klyntar.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.943
It would free our creator.

30:18.068 --> 30:19.653
Well, thank God we haven't died.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.238
Yeah, except that one time.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.201
Oh, no. No.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.453
So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.289
That's why the Xenophage
is hunting us.

30:31.582 --> 30:32.583
What do we do?

30:32.666 --> 30:34.168
She can only see the codex

30:34.251 --> 30:37.296
when a symbiote
is in its full true form.

30:39.965 --> 30:41.049
Right.

30:41.717 --> 30:42.885
You mean you can't come out?

30:42.968 --> 30:45.345
I can do this. I can do this.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.681
But if I fully transform,

30:47.764 --> 30:50.475
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

30:50.559 --> 30:53.312
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

30:53.395 --> 30:55.063
and free Knull from Klyntar.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.690
So how do we
get rid of this codex?

30:56.815 --> 31:01.695
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

31:01.778 --> 31:03.614
-If one of us should die...
-No.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.740
...the codex would die.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.700
-That's not gonna work for me.
-Nor me!

31:07.701 --> 31:09.786
That Xenophage was fast.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.622
It won't take long
for the feds to tie us

31:11.705 --> 31:14.583
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.210
-We gotta get out of here.
-Yeah, we better go.

31:22.174 --> 31:24.176
Four legs are better than one.

31:24.301 --> 31:26.094
Be honest with me, buddy.

31:27.095 --> 31:30.098
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go?

31:30.224 --> 31:31.600
Without killing it.

31:31.683 --> 31:32.935
Only one way to find out.

31:34.353 --> 31:37.731
Don't scare him.
Don't scare horsey-horsey-horse.

31:40.025 --> 31:41.735
Nice horsey.

31:41.818 --> 31:42.945
Hey.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.488
Nice horsey.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.866
Surprise, horsey!

31:49.159 --> 31:50.494
I love horsey!

31:51.203 --> 31:52.204
Wow.

31:58.961 --> 32:00.087
Just go.

32:02.631 --> 32:04.424
Yeehaw!

32:09.471 --> 32:11.390
Ride me, cowboy!

32:11.473 --> 32:13.433
You are an asshole!

32:13.559 --> 32:15.602
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

32:15.686 --> 32:17.437
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you mother--

32:25.821 --> 32:27.614
Now that's horsepower!

32:42.880 --> 32:43.881
Safe haven?

32:44.548 --> 32:46.925
No. They're not here
for a safe haven.

32:47.968 --> 32:50.304
How about a new home?
Evict the current tenants.

32:50.429 --> 32:53.599
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

32:56.518 --> 32:57.519
Have I?

33:04.193 --> 33:06.236
They were running.
That's what he said.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.030
Don't kid yourself.

33:08.155 --> 33:09.781
They were always migrating.

33:09.907 --> 33:12.409
A meteor carrying symbiote life

33:12.492 --> 33:15.245
crashes on Earth,
and they all survive.

33:15.329 --> 33:16.538
Coincidence?

33:16.622 --> 33:17.873
Give me a break.

33:19.333 --> 33:20.542
All right.

33:22.044 --> 33:23.420
Let's go get 'em.

33:24.963 --> 33:26.423
You're so desperate to believe

33:26.507 --> 33:28.425
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.053
Makes you dangerous.

33:41.146 --> 33:43.232
We just intercepted
an emergency call

33:43.357 --> 33:44.691
from an Airbus out of Mexico

33:44.775 --> 33:47.194
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

33:48.070 --> 33:49.154
We'll take the Osprey.

33:49.988 --> 33:51.198
Eyes wide, Paine.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.918
I can't feel my balls.

34:06.588 --> 34:07.881
That was horrible.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.315
Visual on suspect.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.570
Take him out.

34:29.695 --> 34:33.156
-Collect the symbiote.
-Team Six engaged.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.543
Let's go.

36:21.098 --> 36:22.140
No! The codex!

36:22.224 --> 36:23.684
Can't let you die.

36:43.412 --> 36:45.038
Where did that come from?

36:58.051 --> 36:59.720
-Morph!
-Copy.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.521
-Time to go!
-Hell yeah!

37:47.976 --> 37:49.102
What happened?

37:49.186 --> 37:50.646
There's something else out here.

37:50.771 --> 37:52.814
-Something else?
-He said this would happen.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.566
I just lost three people.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.235
Can you collect any samples?

37:57.903 --> 37:59.029
Samples?

38:20.217 --> 38:21.885
Those were not feds.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.137
Those were some
special forces shit.

38:24.221 --> 38:26.431
-They were trying to kill us.
-Yeah.

38:26.515 --> 38:30.143
Yeah, great. Great.
So now we have the cops,

38:30.227 --> 38:31.520
the United States Army

38:31.603 --> 38:35.399
and some creature
from hell hunting us.

38:36.316 --> 38:39.319
Oh, God, I just saw
blood mist spray

38:39.403 --> 38:41.530
out of the back
of an alien's face.

38:51.331 --> 38:52.833
I killed someone.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.085
They didn't give you a choice.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.963
You didn't give me a choice.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.256
I couldn't get to you.

38:59.339 --> 39:02.426
Not in the rapids. A year ago
when you stole my life.

39:02.509 --> 39:04.303
We've been together
for a whole year?

39:04.428 --> 39:06.346
A year too long.
Just stay hidden

39:06.430 --> 39:08.515
while we get to New York
without getting killed.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.737
We need you to come out.

39:25.949 --> 39:28.035
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

39:28.744 --> 39:29.745
It's here.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.666
It killed some people.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.399
Wow.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.779
He's so beautiful.

40:24.258 --> 40:25.884
I sense...

40:27.511 --> 40:30.305
I sense my own.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.480
And yet,

40:38.564 --> 40:43.485
the one Knull seeks is not here.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.866
What does he seek?

40:52.536 --> 40:54.079
The black one.

40:54.830 --> 40:55.998
Brock's symbiote?

40:56.081 --> 40:59.459
He's the only one
who carries a codex.

41:01.336 --> 41:05.632
The end is Knull.

41:12.973 --> 41:14.892
You need your suit.

41:15.017 --> 41:17.394
Still worried
about giving this thing a cold?

41:18.145 --> 41:21.481
Venom carries the key
to Knull's freedom.

41:21.565 --> 41:24.109
He must never obtain it.

41:24.193 --> 41:25.611
Or your race will be killed.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.155
You.

41:29.781 --> 41:31.325
And you.

41:31.867 --> 41:33.076
And...

41:33.827 --> 41:35.579
you.

41:37.456 --> 41:40.626
Everyone, everything.

41:40.709 --> 41:43.003
How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?

41:43.086 --> 41:44.796
You can't.

41:45.964 --> 41:48.592
He's older than the universe.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.178
He needs the key.

41:51.845 --> 41:56.558
Then everything will end.

41:59.561 --> 42:01.855
How do we stop him
from getting it?

42:01.980 --> 42:06.193
If the symbiote
and the host are alive,

42:07.069 --> 42:10.113
then the codex is alive.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.742
And if one of them dies?

42:13.867 --> 42:15.702
The codex dies.

42:15.827 --> 42:18.121
The codex dies.

42:19.957 --> 42:22.417
-Rex, you can't be serious.
-Oh, I'm game.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.294
Destroying the codex
is the only way

42:24.419 --> 42:26.171
it remains unobtainable. Right?

42:27.881 --> 42:29.007
Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.342
Destroying it?

42:30.467 --> 42:32.135
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

42:32.261 --> 42:33.971
My people are dead.

42:35.472 --> 42:38.350
Something is coming
that cannot be beaten.

42:39.184 --> 42:40.477
I'm stopping
all this shit right now.

42:40.602 --> 42:41.854
Science is sacrifice.

42:41.937 --> 42:43.063
Teddy.

42:43.981 --> 42:45.858
This is serious.

42:45.941 --> 42:47.609
Listen to her.

43:33.113 --> 43:35.449
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

43:37.868 --> 43:39.411
Is everything okay?

43:43.624 --> 43:44.625
Yeah.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.464
I smell wet dog. And sausamages!

43:50.547 --> 43:51.798
Hey, friend-o.

43:52.424 --> 43:53.425
You okay, there?

43:55.844 --> 43:57.429
No, I'm not okay.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.349
It's pretty wild out there.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.226
-I know.
-Yeah.

44:02.309 --> 44:03.310
You hungry?

44:03.435 --> 44:04.937
Yes.

44:05.020 --> 44:06.021
Come over.

44:07.105 --> 44:08.106
Thank you.

44:08.232 --> 44:11.193
-So this is my wife, Nova Moon.
-Hi.

44:11.318 --> 44:14.613
And these are my kids.
Echo and Leaf.

44:14.738 --> 44:16.698
-A lifetime in therapy.
-Don't.

44:16.823 --> 44:17.950
Huh?

44:18.617 --> 44:23.205
Don't you dare! Wow.
How beautiful are your children.

44:24.122 --> 44:25.415
And that's Blue.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.544
-Who is a...
-Dog.

44:28.669 --> 44:30.420
And I'm Martin.

44:30.504 --> 44:32.297
-Hey, Martin.
-Hey.

44:32.381 --> 44:33.382
I'm Eddie.

44:33.465 --> 44:35.300
-Nice to meet you, Eddie.
-You too. Pleasure.

44:35.425 --> 44:39.096
-Come, sit, please. Come on.
-Okay. Thank you.

44:39.972 --> 44:41.431
Jesus Christ.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.560
So, right.

44:46.061 --> 44:48.856
So nothing died on that plate.
Namaste, man.

44:48.981 --> 44:51.024
-Thank you.
-Hard pass!

44:52.442 --> 44:53.652
Oh, dear.

44:54.653 --> 44:56.613
-Eddie, where you headed?
-New York.

44:56.697 --> 44:57.698
Oh, wow.

44:57.823 --> 44:58.824
-Yeah.
-All right.

44:58.907 --> 45:01.869
Long way to New York
with naked shrimps, man.

45:01.994 --> 45:03.412
Yeah.

45:03.537 --> 45:05.664
We could ride you out to Vegas.

45:05.789 --> 45:06.790
Yeah.

45:06.874 --> 45:09.251
These people are weird,
I'm telling you.

45:09.334 --> 45:10.502
That would be so kind.
Thank you.

45:10.586 --> 45:11.587
You're welcome.

45:11.670 --> 45:13.088
Of course.
Life's one big adventure.

45:13.172 --> 45:14.548
Who doesn't love
making new friends?

45:14.673 --> 45:15.799
-Right?
-Right?

45:15.883 --> 45:19.094
This guy is so one of those
serial killer hitchhikers

45:19.178 --> 45:21.305
from my favourite
murder podcast.

45:21.430 --> 45:23.223
Baby. Not now.

45:23.348 --> 45:25.517
How has social services
not taken us away yet?

45:26.351 --> 45:29.146
She... She... She's joking.

45:29.271 --> 45:32.024
-I'm not.
-Please, honey.

45:33.233 --> 45:35.152
So we're riding
the Extraterrestrial Highway.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.486
-Yeah.
-The whatchamawhosit?

45:36.612 --> 45:39.031
It's the road
that leads to Area 51.

45:39.156 --> 45:41.450
See if we can't spot us an alien

45:41.575 --> 45:43.619
before they shut the place down
forever, you know?

45:43.744 --> 45:45.746
It's my lifelong dream.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.247
We could show him right now!

45:47.331 --> 45:48.332
Not a believer?

45:50.834 --> 45:52.461
Actually, Martin...

45:53.629 --> 45:55.297
How do I put this?

45:57.382 --> 45:58.717
I am.

45:58.842 --> 46:02.054
Actually, I am a big,
big believer.

46:02.137 --> 46:04.223
-You're not that big.
-Oh, you a comedian now?

46:04.348 --> 46:06.433
No, actually, I was in IT.

46:06.517 --> 46:07.559
-Were you?
-Yeah.

46:07.643 --> 46:10.229
-That's so cool.
-Oh, thanks.

46:10.354 --> 46:13.982
I hope you don't get
disappointed, you know?

46:14.066 --> 46:18.278
And I hope that if you
do find one, I hope you meet...

46:19.154 --> 46:22.908
a really good alien, not a...

46:24.535 --> 46:25.994
not a bad...

46:27.246 --> 46:28.247
one.

46:28.372 --> 46:29.706
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

46:29.790 --> 46:31.291
Well...

46:31.375 --> 46:34.837
I know a dark force
when I see one, Eddie.

46:43.971 --> 46:46.265
It's kinda hot in here.

46:46.431 --> 46:48.100
Oh, you'll get used to it.

46:48.225 --> 46:50.060
AC's really bad
for your health, you know.

46:52.104 --> 46:53.772
All right. Family ready?

46:53.897 --> 46:56.733
-Yup.
-Guest ready?

46:56.859 --> 46:58.861
Let's rock this camper.

47:00.696 --> 47:03.323
Ground control to Major Tom

47:04.867 --> 47:06.243
Oh, I love a singalong!

47:06.368 --> 47:08.954
Ground control to Major Tom

47:10.205 --> 47:11.707
Shoot me in the face.

47:11.832 --> 47:15.586
Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on

47:15.669 --> 47:18.130
-Oh, yeah! This is my jam!
-Ten...

47:18.213 --> 47:19.298
...nine...

47:19.423 --> 47:22.885
...eight, seven, six...

47:22.968 --> 47:24.928
Commencing countdown,
engines on

47:25.012 --> 47:26.471
...five, four...

47:26.555 --> 47:28.765
...three, two, one.

47:28.849 --> 47:32.352
Check ignition
and may God's love be with you

47:32.436 --> 47:35.022
Lift-off!

47:35.147 --> 47:37.441
-Come on, Eddie, sing along!
-I'm good, thanks.

47:37.524 --> 47:38.692
You know the words!

47:38.775 --> 47:40.444
Just think of this
as the tour bus.

47:40.527 --> 47:42.029
We're the band,
and you can be the groupie.

47:42.154 --> 47:44.364
Come on! Don't be square.

47:44.448 --> 47:45.532
Don't get me started.

47:45.657 --> 47:48.869
This is Major Tom
to ground control

47:49.536 --> 47:52.956
I'm stepping through the door

47:53.081 --> 47:57.878
And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way

47:57.961 --> 47:58.962
Cheer up!

47:59.087 --> 48:03.800
And the stars look
very different today

48:03.926 --> 48:05.052
Why?

48:05.135 --> 48:08.055
-For here am I
-Why is this happening?

48:08.180 --> 48:10.933
-Sitting in a tin can
-Can made of tin!

48:11.058 --> 48:15.187
Far above the world

48:15.270 --> 48:16.396
Like a bathtub, Eddie.

48:16.522 --> 48:18.232
Planet Earth is blue

48:18.899 --> 48:23.320
And there's nothing I can do

48:23.445 --> 48:26.865
This is ground control
to Major Tom

48:26.949 --> 48:28.617
Sometimes I think we would

48:28.700 --> 48:31.370
have been happier
with a life like this.

48:31.453 --> 48:34.331
And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear

48:34.414 --> 48:35.624
You know?

48:36.542 --> 48:37.543
Yep.

48:37.626 --> 48:39.586
Now it's time
to leave the capsule...

48:39.670 --> 48:42.172
-I know.
-...if you dare

48:44.007 --> 48:47.344
This is Major Tom
to ground control

48:47.427 --> 48:49.972
I'm stepping through the door

48:51.390 --> 48:56.311
And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way

48:57.104 --> 49:01.984
And the stars look
very different today

49:02.109 --> 49:07.573
For here am I
sitting in a tin can

49:08.407 --> 49:12.744
Far above the world

49:44.568 --> 49:46.153
You like chocolate?

49:48.155 --> 49:49.823
They don't let us eat sugar.

49:51.366 --> 49:52.367
They don't?

49:54.328 --> 49:57.414
I have a friend
who loves chocolate. Thank you.

49:57.539 --> 49:59.166
It's very kind of you.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.922
I don't wanna see an alien.

50:05.047 --> 50:06.256
You don't?

50:07.966 --> 50:09.384
It's scary.

50:12.346 --> 50:13.555
Okay.

50:14.473 --> 50:16.558
Well, you know,
it's okay to be scared.

50:18.519 --> 50:20.270
I'm scared, like...

50:21.063 --> 50:22.356
like, all the time.

50:23.482 --> 50:25.150
Promise I won't see one?

50:29.780 --> 50:30.989
Buddy.

50:32.658 --> 50:35.369
Aliens are not real.

50:35.452 --> 50:36.662
Okay?

50:36.745 --> 50:38.121
I promise.

50:39.831 --> 50:41.041
Okay?

50:49.007 --> 50:51.093
You said the right thing.

50:51.176 --> 50:53.220
You would make a good dad.

51:07.150 --> 51:10.070
We've come a long way,
you and me.

51:11.321 --> 51:13.407
We have many more roads
to travel, buddy.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.825
Wouldn't that be nice?

51:14.908 --> 51:16.535
You say something?

51:19.204 --> 51:22.416
No. Just dreaming, I guess.

51:31.091 --> 51:32.593
That's the Nierika.

51:33.802 --> 51:34.928
"Nierika"?

51:35.012 --> 51:36.263
Yeah.

51:36.388 --> 51:38.348
There's a doorway in our minds

51:38.432 --> 51:40.934
that usually remains
hidden and secret

51:41.018 --> 51:43.061
until the time of death.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.441
Crazy things
in this world, Eddie.

51:49.651 --> 51:52.070
You can see 'em
if you're open.

51:53.363 --> 51:55.032
Oh, I seen them.

51:58.493 --> 52:01.580
I'm glad we didn't
eat this fine family.

52:30.150 --> 52:33.195
Welcome to the city
of second chances.

52:50.879 --> 52:52.130
Thank you, thank you.

52:52.214 --> 52:53.799
Take care, buddy. Thank you.

52:53.882 --> 52:55.092
Stay, Blue. Stay.

52:55.175 --> 52:56.176
Thank you. Take care, Blue.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.302
Vegas.

53:02.724 --> 53:04.685
Listen, I just want you
to have this.

53:05.561 --> 53:07.145
-Please. And...
-Oh, Martin, that's a lot of--

53:07.271 --> 53:10.023
-Thank you.
-Quality support cushioning.

53:10.148 --> 53:13.318
Plus, they come with
an antimicrobial footbed.

53:13.402 --> 53:16.280
No! Reject them.
Worse than Crocs.

53:16.363 --> 53:17.698
Thank you.

53:17.823 --> 53:22.077
Oh, baby, baby,
it's a wild world

53:22.160 --> 53:23.996
But I'll always remember you

53:28.292 --> 53:29.293
Goodbye, Martin.

53:30.627 --> 53:32.004
It's goodbye for now.

53:32.087 --> 53:34.131
That's what I like to think,
Eddie.

53:35.424 --> 53:36.884
Okay, bye.

53:36.967 --> 53:38.177
Hey, Martin.

53:40.721 --> 53:42.097
You know that doorway...

53:42.222 --> 53:43.724
The Nierika?

53:43.849 --> 53:45.851
Yeah. It's open.

53:46.518 --> 53:48.103
All right? Just...

53:49.021 --> 53:50.189
Be safe.

53:52.149 --> 53:53.150
Okay.

53:53.984 --> 53:55.235
Thanks.

54:02.534 --> 54:03.869
Oh, Jesus.

54:05.537 --> 54:07.456
Well, this is an all-time low.

54:16.048 --> 54:17.633
You have chocolate!

54:20.010 --> 54:21.011
Yum!

54:29.853 --> 54:34.233
I would like to see her
when we get to New York, Eddie.

54:34.900 --> 54:36.109
You know, she was built

54:36.193 --> 54:38.654
to welcome visitors
to America, buddy.

54:38.737 --> 54:40.155
And that's you.

54:40.280 --> 54:42.032
You think so, Eddie?

54:42.157 --> 54:43.492
Oh, yeah. I know so.

54:44.368 --> 54:46.245
When we get out of this mess,
we'll go see her.

54:46.328 --> 54:48.163
We'll say, "Hi, Lady Liberty."

54:48.247 --> 54:50.791
And see a Broadway show!

54:50.874 --> 54:51.959
Yeah, sure.

54:52.042 --> 54:53.043
Wow!

54:53.544 --> 54:56.046
I know how much
you hate musicals.

54:57.881 --> 54:59.508
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

55:14.815 --> 55:16.525
What's next, Thelma?

55:16.608 --> 55:17.943
Well, Louise,

55:18.902 --> 55:21.196
I'm not sure 20 bucks
is gonna get us much

55:21.280 --> 55:23.115
in the way of a motor transport.

55:24.324 --> 55:28.620
And I'm not ever riding
an alien horse again.

55:28.704 --> 55:31.373
So I guess it looks like
we're stealing cars.

55:31.456 --> 55:33.000
No, I've watched Rain Man,

55:33.083 --> 55:36.753
and in my infinite wisdom
as a celestial being,

55:36.837 --> 55:38.672
working the system is easy.

55:39.339 --> 55:43.010
We hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette!

55:43.093 --> 55:44.344
Bingo-bango!

55:44.469 --> 55:47.681
Luxury ride,
Bluetooth sound system, AC

55:47.764 --> 55:50.225
and the top down.

55:50.309 --> 55:52.561
Because that's how we roll.

55:52.644 --> 55:54.605
Paris Casino
has a strict dress code.

55:56.523 --> 56:00.694
No, you know what? It's a hotel.
These are my vacation clothes.

56:00.777 --> 56:02.112
Get better ones.

56:02.196 --> 56:04.239
He's not wrong. Look at you.

56:06.116 --> 56:07.910
Don't push it, all right, buddy?

56:08.827 --> 56:10.287
-Want a hand?
-Yes.

56:12.873 --> 56:15.334
I didn't mean knock him out.
What are you doing?

56:15.417 --> 56:17.127
-He was being a dick.
-Yeah, but...

56:17.211 --> 56:18.879
Oh! Look.

56:21.965 --> 56:23.926
We need a disguise.

56:25.928 --> 56:27.471
What are we doing?

56:27.554 --> 56:29.139
-Hey.
-Hey, man.

56:29.264 --> 56:30.265
Hi.

56:33.185 --> 56:34.186
Oh, God.

56:34.269 --> 56:35.562
Warm.

56:41.568 --> 56:43.403
Why do you keep
knocking people out?

56:43.487 --> 56:44.905
What is wrong with you?

56:44.988 --> 56:46.490
Jesus, why?

56:47.407 --> 56:49.576
So sorry, buddy.

56:49.660 --> 56:51.828
I am so, so sorry.

56:51.912 --> 56:54.289
Eddie! Yeah, baby.

56:54.373 --> 56:57.668
Now no one will recognise us.

56:57.751 --> 56:58.752
Seriously.

56:59.586 --> 57:03.882
You could get voted
People's Sexiest Man of the Year

57:03.966 --> 57:06.593
if anyone cared
who you were any more.

57:06.677 --> 57:08.595
I've won
Sexy Man awards before.

57:08.679 --> 57:09.721
'Course you have.

57:11.056 --> 57:12.474
-Hey. Hey.
-Yeah?

57:12.558 --> 57:13.725
The guy that did that?

57:13.809 --> 57:16.353
I saw it.
He's in the arch over there.

57:16.436 --> 57:17.771
-He's shit-faced.
-All right.

57:19.398 --> 57:20.983
We are bad people.

57:21.066 --> 57:22.651
Yeah, we are!

57:22.776 --> 57:24.611
We're keeping these shoes,
by the way.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.324
We are so money, and we know it!

57:29.408 --> 57:30.784
Welcome to the Paris.

57:30.868 --> 57:32.244
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

57:32.327 --> 57:34.454
-Just sit on the ground.
-What happened?

57:48.802 --> 57:50.679
Oh, yes!

57:50.846 --> 57:54.558
Let me multiply that 20.
Let me quadruplify it.

57:54.683 --> 57:56.059
What are you doing?

57:56.935 --> 57:58.770
No. This is all the money
that we have.

57:58.896 --> 58:01.190
Luck, be a lady tonight

58:01.273 --> 58:02.649
No.

58:04.735 --> 58:07.446
Smashing jacket!
Let's eat him and steal it!

58:12.075 --> 58:14.703
I know Lady Luck
is on our side tonight!

58:14.786 --> 58:16.246
No, I would say that Lady Luck

58:16.330 --> 58:18.040
is definitely
not on your side tonight.

58:18.123 --> 58:20.292
In fact, I would even
go so far to say

58:20.375 --> 58:22.377
that Lady Luck hates you, buddy.

58:22.503 --> 58:25.297
-I can't stop now!
-Of course you can't stop.

58:25.422 --> 58:26.423
What is this feeling?

58:26.507 --> 58:27.591
-It's like: Aaah!
-This feeling?

58:27.674 --> 58:29.718
It's like all of my problems
have gone away!

58:29.843 --> 58:31.887
Do this all the time!

58:36.600 --> 58:37.601
Eddie.

58:37.684 --> 58:39.394
I need more money.

58:41.730 --> 58:44.066
But we don't have
any more money, buddy.

58:44.191 --> 58:45.817
Goddamn it!

58:47.152 --> 58:48.779
You are a sore loser.

58:48.904 --> 58:50.322
You're a sore loser!

58:52.449 --> 58:53.992
I think you broke my foot.

58:54.743 --> 58:56.745
Lady Luck is a fickle slut!

58:57.371 --> 58:59.748
We should have played
that machine!

59:01.375 --> 59:03.252
No effing way.

59:05.712 --> 59:06.880
Eddie Brock?

59:07.005 --> 59:09.299
Mrs Chen! That's not yours.

59:09.424 --> 59:12.177
-I'm sorry.
-Eddie! It's Mrs Chen!

59:12.302 --> 59:13.679
Oh, Mrs Chen!

59:13.804 --> 59:14.805
Eddie, baby!

59:14.888 --> 59:17.224
Mrs Chen! Mrs Chen! Mrs Chen!

59:17.349 --> 59:19.393
-I'm gonna cry.
-Me too.

59:20.769 --> 59:23.021
Wow. What happened to you?

59:23.146 --> 59:24.147
You look hot!

59:24.231 --> 59:25.899
-So do you.
-Really hot.

59:25.983 --> 59:27.359
-I always look hot.
-Yeah.

59:27.484 --> 59:29.194
-Is the big guy in there?
-Yeah.

59:29.319 --> 59:30.696
Do you like my dress?

59:30.779 --> 59:32.281
I've been winning so big,
they gave me

59:32.364 --> 59:33.532
a credit line
at the clothes store.

59:33.615 --> 59:35.158
And then the penthouse suite!

59:35.284 --> 59:39.496
Wow. You know I stole this suit
off a guy who pissed on me.

59:39.580 --> 59:41.707
I knocked him out.
I left him in a bush.

59:41.790 --> 59:43.667
Well, that explains the stink.

59:43.792 --> 59:47.045
You could use my room
to clean up, and then we party.

59:47.171 --> 59:48.714
Oh, that would be so good.

59:48.839 --> 59:50.716
And room service.

59:52.009 --> 59:53.218
Yes!

01:00:03.812 --> 01:00:06.106
We got him.
Positive ID on Brock.

01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.943
CCTV hit,
the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:12.529
-Have we reconstituted The Six?
-Yes, sir.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:14.323
Put 'em in.

01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.672
The Six are en route.

01:00:30.756 --> 01:00:32.257
They'll bring him in.

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.219
At this time,
I'm requesting control

01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:37.387
of the Imperium Programme.

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:41.808
You have my permission, general.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:55.656
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.634
Let's dance, baby.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:18.136
-No. No.
-Yeah! I love dancing!

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.806
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:21.974
Don't be a party pooper.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:24.810
No! Do not encourage him.

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:25.936
You know what, Mrs Chen?

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:27.688
We are fugitives.
We are on the run.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:30.399
So, thank you for having us.
We gotta go.

01:01:30.524 --> 01:01:31.650
You're no fun!

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.902
One last dance before you go.

01:01:33.986 --> 01:01:35.028
We never do anything

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:36.238
-I want to do.
-What?

01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:38.073
Just a little dance.

01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:42.035
And you gave away my chickens.

01:01:43.662 --> 01:01:44.663
Yeah!

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.172
Let's cut a rug, Mrs Chen.

01:01:53.964 --> 01:01:55.007
I give up.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:08.896
Oh, no, I cannot unsee that.
I cannot unsee that!

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:14.693
You can dance

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.904
You can dan...

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:20.657
Having the time of our lives

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.583
When did you two practise this?

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:54.983
Goddamnit!

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:57.152
I told you this would happen!

01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:01.823
Don't panic.
She can't see the codex.

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:03.534
What the hell is that?

01:03:03.659 --> 01:03:05.661
Wow. So ugly!

01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:09.039
Stay very calm.

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:11.041
She can't see the thing
she's looking for.

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:21.718
Go, go, go!

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:31.311
Target acquired.

01:03:31.395 --> 01:03:33.105
-You leave Eddie alone!
-Silence!

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:36.358
My shoes.

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:38.026
Go. Move out, move out!

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:07.014
Wow.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.102
Area 51.

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:13.854
Yeah.

01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:15.189
Yeah.

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:18.275
We made it.

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:23.197
You finally got to see it, Dad.

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:25.866
It's kind of cool...

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:28.035
I guess.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:29.953
Yeah.

01:04:33.165 --> 01:04:34.166
Leaf.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:37.044
Where you goin', hon?

01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:39.505
Well, let's see
if we can't find us

01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:41.381
something cooler. Come on.

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:42.591
Come on, guys.

01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:45.010
Okay, babe. Lifelong dream.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:46.720
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:48.889
I smell alien.

01:04:55.062 --> 01:04:57.189
He's deteriorating
without his host.

01:04:58.023 --> 01:04:59.191
Poor thing.

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:02.194
Put him below with the others.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:03.612
Safer there.

01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:41.817
Down, down. Come on, come on.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.203
All right.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:57.833
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

01:05:59.084 --> 01:06:01.336
Follow me, guys. Come on.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.380
This is so exciting.

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:05.090
I can't believe we're here.

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:26.403
Wow. Oh, wow.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.573
What is this?

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.377
It's all broken.

01:06:43.879 --> 01:06:45.172
So sad.

01:06:57.768 --> 01:06:59.102
Buddy?

01:07:00.312 --> 01:07:01.647
Hey, buddy?

01:07:04.525 --> 01:07:06.360
Oh, no.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.404
No.

01:07:11.949 --> 01:07:16.078
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day?

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:18.872
Eddie?

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:25.170
Hello?

01:07:27.673 --> 01:07:29.132
They did this to me.

01:07:31.969 --> 01:07:33.011
Mulligan?

01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:35.180
Why?

01:07:35.264 --> 01:07:36.390
You're alive?

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.434
What are you doing here?

01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:43.397
We're being hunted, Eddie.

01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:46.567
You have what he needs.

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:51.989
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:56.451
A symbiote army waits here.

01:07:56.535 --> 01:07:58.078
Free them.

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:00.539
Protect it, Eddie.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.541
Knull...

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:07.087
must stay locked away.

01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:13.260
Eddie, I'm Dr Paine.

01:08:15.971 --> 01:08:16.971
Where's my friend?

01:08:17.096 --> 01:08:18.182
He's safe for now.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.850
Great news!

01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:23.103
-Oh, shit.
-We're all done here.

01:08:23.228 --> 01:08:25.272
All of this
is out of your hands.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.564
This is my lab.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.901
No, no, not yours.
You just work here.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:30.109
Or you did.

01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.904
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

01:08:32.487 --> 01:08:33.947
And what about them?

01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:35.073
-You heard what it said.
-Hands up.

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:36.950
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.410
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.162
You killed one of my people.

01:08:41.246 --> 01:08:42.997
I'm returning the favour
personally. Please escort

01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:44.082
-Dr Paine out of here.
-No.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.167
-Don't move.
-Christmas!

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.292
Time to go.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:47.502
Hey!

01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:58.305
Big mistake.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.897
-Fire!
-Run!

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:12.861
-Oh, my God!
-Fall back, fall back!

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:14.738
Go!

01:09:19.618 --> 01:09:21.995
Venom, run. Go!

01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:32.881
Let's go! Move! Clear! Clear!

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.385
Release the symbiotes!

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.553
Go! Go!

01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:47.688
-Come on.
-Go! Go!

01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:01.285
Hurry up! Move!

01:10:02.035 --> 01:10:03.036
Get back!

01:10:04.413 --> 01:10:05.664
Jim!

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:20.804
Let's go.

01:10:20.929 --> 01:10:22.055
Take her down.

01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:56.840
Come on!

01:11:03.055 --> 01:11:04.973
Get the codex out of here.

01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:13.190
That's our way out.

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:26.203
You, break us out of here!

01:11:30.207 --> 01:11:32.417
There's no aliens here, kids.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:39.007
Best shoes ever!

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:41.260
Whoa! What was that?

01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:47.766
-Okay.
-We gotta go! Move it!

01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:57.359
We are leaving!

01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.027
Move!

01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:00.362
Move, move!

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:04.908
-Dad.
-It's all right, kids.

01:12:10.706 --> 01:12:13.500
Aliens! Alien invasion!

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:15.335
Alien attack!

01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:26.096
Motherfucker!

01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:33.187
-You two, get airborne!
-Right away, sir!

01:12:33.312 --> 01:12:34.354
On me!

01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:37.983
Hurry up, airborne! Move, move,
move! In the Hummers! Go!

01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.444
We've got to get the codex
as far away as possible.

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:44.990
-It's Eddie?
-It's Eddie.

01:12:45.532 --> 01:12:47.201
-Eddie! Hey!
-Eddie!

01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:48.744
-Oh, no.
-Eddie, Eddie!

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:53.957
Martin. And family.

01:12:58.962 --> 01:13:00.005
You can't be here, Martin.

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:01.882
Dark forces, man.

01:13:19.733 --> 01:13:21.485
Eddie, can you help us?

01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:24.655
I lied. Aliens are real.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.907
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:28.242
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:29.952
Okay.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.957
-Don't... Don't be scared.
-Hi.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.041
Wow.

01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:38.043
Pleasure to meet you.

01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:40.963
Thanks for the chocolate.

01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:42.756
You're welcome.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.606
No!

01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:04.152
Mom, Dad!

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:13.704
Dad!

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:15.289
Hold on, kids!

01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:19.960
Hold on, kids!

01:14:23.046 --> 01:14:24.631
Eddie!

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:38.937
He was trying to protect you.

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:41.815
We are not the bad guys!

01:14:45.277 --> 01:14:46.778
Echo! Leaf.

01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:48.113
-My baby, my baby.
-Mom!

01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:49.865
-Thank you, Eddie.
-You're welcome.

01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:55.746
You gotta be kidding me.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:06.632
Get in!

01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:07.966
Run. Run.

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:09.384
Run!

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:12.387
Eddie!

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.737
Go. Bring me that codex.

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.451
What's that noise?

01:15:34.576 --> 01:15:36.703
She phoned home.

01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.001
Oh, shit.

01:16:05.274 --> 01:16:08.026
-Jesus!
-Get down! Get down! Get under!

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:10.487
Take cover! Take cover!
I got you.

01:16:21.039 --> 01:16:22.958
She saved us.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.378
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:27.588
Copy.

01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:32.676
-Get 'em back to their van!
-What?

01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:34.636
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:39.224
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

01:16:41.602 --> 01:16:43.520
Go, go, go! Go!

01:16:57.034 --> 01:16:58.452
Go!

01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:02.122
He's leading them to a kill box.

01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:04.166
When you get a lock,
vaporise 'em!

01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:31.235
We're home. We're back.
Okay, okay. Hold it.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.445
-Run!
-Go, kids! Go! Come on!

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:34.571
Hurry. Hurry, honey.

01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:37.115
Thank you!

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.244
Aliens suck!

01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:05.519
-Light 'em up!
-Copy that.

01:18:17.865 --> 01:18:19.199
Target eliminated.

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:24.288
No! No!

01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:25.747
Thompson down!

01:18:25.873 --> 01:18:27.749
It's coming down. Go!

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:45.559
Slide!

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.857
Oh, sh--!

01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:53.817
Go away!

01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:03.994
Let's finish this.

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.787
With pleasure.

01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:13.629
The chopper blades!

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:37.069
I got you.

01:19:42.658 --> 01:19:44.743
-It's okay.
-Get him somewhere safe.

01:19:47.246 --> 01:19:48.247
Oh, God.

01:20:13.105 --> 01:20:15.440
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

01:20:16.275 --> 01:20:17.651
Okay. Okay.

01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:38.755
No.

01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:42.718
Okay. Okay.

01:20:46.763 --> 01:20:48.891
Still living
your brother's dream?

01:20:56.064 --> 01:20:57.357
Oh, my God.

01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:04.823
-I'm coming! I'm coming!
-Dad, come on!

01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:07.159
Dad! Dad! Run! Come on!

01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:36.438
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:38.273
You did it all yourself.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.360
Well, some of it.

01:21:57.835 --> 01:22:00.420
I really would have liked
to have seen her.

01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:06.844
Who?

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:09.012
Lady Liberty.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.390
Oh, yeah.

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:15.894
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, we're going.

01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:19.189
We're gonna go just as soon
as we get...

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.608
out of here.

01:22:23.527 --> 01:22:25.863
They're just going
to keep coming.

01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:28.115
We'll never leave
this place, friend.

01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:41.378
Okay, well...

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:46.884
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:52.306
We are.

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:54.892
That's what this is.

01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:06.278
Yeah.

01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:32.971
All right.

01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:38.644
All right.

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:51.156
Come and get us.

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:56.471
Go.

01:24:57.472 --> 01:24:58.891
Go.

01:24:58.974 --> 01:24:59.975
Go.

01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:07.441
Oh, my God.

01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:19.828
What are you doin'?

01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:25.042
I'll never forget you.

01:25:28.837 --> 01:25:31.882
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

01:25:32.007 --> 01:25:33.175
No.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.676
Time to go.

01:25:37.888 --> 01:25:40.390
-Strickland.
-Strickland authorised.

01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:43.310
No.

01:26:01.578 --> 01:26:03.789
-Strickland.
-Strickland authorised.

01:26:27.145 --> 01:26:29.189
It's just bye for now.

01:26:48.834 --> 01:26:49.877
No.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.961
No!

01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:52.462
No! No!

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:28.582
Go!

01:27:56.527 --> 01:27:58.111
No, Eddie!

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.948
Eddie!

01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:02.032
Oh, my God.

01:28:51.707 --> 01:28:53.208
Nierika.

01:29:18.025 --> 01:29:19.359
Hey, buddy.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.155
I just had a crazy dream.

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:31.622
Buddy?

01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:33.332
He's not coming back.

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:43.217
But I need him back.

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:46.220
He wasn't meant for this place.

01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:48.013
You couldn't have kept him...

01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:50.474
and he couldn't have kept you.

01:29:52.809 --> 01:29:53.977
For your bravery,

01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:57.314
you both have the heartfelt
thanks of a grateful nation.

01:29:59.858 --> 01:30:01.777
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

01:30:02.653 --> 01:30:04.738
Everything that happened
in San Francisco

01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:06.406
and in the last few days...

01:30:07.032 --> 01:30:08.784
consider it expunged.

01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:17.876
Just so you're clear,
of course...

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.754
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:23.507
you will spend
the rest of that life

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:26.510
in the coldest,
darkest hole imaginable.

01:30:28.929 --> 01:30:30.264
Good luck, Eddie.

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:07.194
I won't forget you, buddy.

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:43.684
Your champion has fallen.

01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:47.813
The planets will be mine.

01:34:48.814 --> 01:34:51.942
The King in Black is awake.

01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:54.987
I will kill your world.

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:58.198
Everyone will burn.

01:34:58.282 --> 01:34:59.616
And you...

01:35:00.576 --> 01:35:02.077
will watch.

01:48:16.705 --> 01:48:18.415
Hello? Hello?

01:48:23.003 --> 01:48:25.672
¿Hola? Hello?
